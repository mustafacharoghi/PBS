# PBS
R code for population branch statistics (PBS) described by `Yi et al. Science 2010`. 

* The code generates Manhattan plot and detailed annotation information for top selected SNPs in the branch of targeted population with highest PBSs.    
* The input format of allele frequency data is `plink.strat.frq` file generated by 
`plink --bfile your_data --freq --missing --within population_cluster_list`
with SNP information from corresponding `.bim` file.
* In input section, you can change the target population and two reference populations to whatever you want.
